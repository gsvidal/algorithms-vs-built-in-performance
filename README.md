# Sorting Algorithm Visualizer

This is a Sorting Algorithm Visualizer application that demonstrates the working of three common sorting algorithms: Selection Sort, Bubble Sort, and Merge Sort. The visualization is done using canvas and bar charts, providing an intuitive way to understand how these algorithms operate on a set of data. User also can modify the size and speed of the algorithms with input controls.

## Introduction

Understanding sorting algorithms can be challenging, especially for beginners. This Sorting Algorithm Visualizer aims to simplify the learning process by providing a visual representation of three different sorting algorithms.

## Features

- **Selection Sort:** Simple but inefficient, repeatedly selects the smallest (or largest) element from an unsorted part of the array and swaps it with the first unsorted element.

- **Bubble Sort:** A basic sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.

- **Merge Sort:** An efficient, comparison-based algorithm that divides the unsorted list into n s

- **Visualization:** Bar charts represent the array elements, and the sorting process is visually demonstrated step by step.
